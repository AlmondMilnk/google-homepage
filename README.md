# google-homepage
Odin Project assignment

The purpose of this mini-project is to start thinking about how elements are
placed and alligned using HTML and CSS.

I utilized flexbox in order to achieve a basic version of the google layout without functionality.

The test deployment can be found [Here](https://almondmilnk.github.io/google-homepage/)

I retrospect the CSS could have been split into a seperate .css file however for the purpose 
of this project, inline css will suffice.
